# insurance-fraud-detection-using-4-models
The goal of this project is to build a model that can detect auto insurance fraud. The challenge behind fraud detection in machine learning is that frauds are far less common as compared to legit insurance claims.



The four model are 
Support vector classifier
Decision tree
K Nearest neighbours (KNN)
Random forest classifier
